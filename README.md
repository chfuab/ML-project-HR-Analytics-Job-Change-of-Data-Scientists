# ML-project-HR-Analytics-Job-Change-of-Data-Scientists

## Background
A company wants to hire data scientists among people who have passed some courses conducted by the company. The company wants to know which of these candidates are really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment. With the demographics, education, experience etc. data during candidates' signup and enrollment, a dataset is designed to understand factors leading to whether a candidate will work for the company or looking for new jobs.

## Aim of the project
This project aims at selecting the machine learning models with the best performance in predicting whether a candidate will look for new employment or not.
